# Virtual Clinic Feature Development

## Enhancing Clinical Communication

Welcome to the Virtual Clinic Feature Development Project!

Hey there, future Medihive superstar! We're thrilled to have you on board for this exciting journey. In this project, you'll be working on developing a new feature for our Virtual Clinic application that aims to enhance communication between medical professionals and patients. This is your chance to shine and show us what you've got!

You'll be tackling real-world scenarios that mirror the kind of work you'd be doing at Medihive. So, roll up your sleeves, put on your thinking cap, and let's get started!

Remember, this is a friendly and supportive environment. We're here to see you succeed, so don't hesitate to ask questions or seek help if you need it. Good luck, and most importantly, have fun!

Note: A repository will be generated for this project. You'll find all the necessary details in the task descriptions.
